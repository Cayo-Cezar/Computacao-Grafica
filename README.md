# Computer Graphics Algorithms (C++ Builder)

This repository contains implementations of **fundamental computer graphics algorithms and geometric transformations**, developed using **C++ Builder (Embarcadero / RAD Studio)** as part of the *Computer Graphics* course at UTFPR.  
The project focuses on classic algorithms such as line drawing, transformations, clipping, curve generation, and basic 3D object visualization.
